# OOPs-lab Repository

## Description
This repository contains Java code solutions for problems from the E2S2 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab manual. The solutions were implemented as part of coursework/lab exercises.

## Contents

### Java Files
- **ClassStuff.java**: Contains class-related implementations
- **Notes.java**: Likely contains notes or helper functions
- **Trial.java**: Initial test/experimental file
- **jdbc.java**: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) related code
- **Assignment_3**: Directory for assignment 3 solutions

### Resources
- **mysql-connector-j-8.0.33.jar**: MySQL JDBC driver for database connectivity

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- For database connectivity: MySQL server (if using JDBC files)
